SLIDcES
=======

SLIDcES is a slide-based js package for creation of 'DC chart pages' aka slides, using DC.js*. The name is a play on '"DC" within Slides'.
Early on in development the acronym 'gdca' was settled upon, which stands for Generic DC, Analysis.
SLIDcES editing is near WYSIWYG; meaning, you add content by making selections in an Edit mode to form or change content. This is not a coding-heavy package. A Run mode is supported for displaying the content, something like PowerPoint presentations.
Unlike PowerPoints, Slides made with SLIDcES are interactive, including Table contents.
